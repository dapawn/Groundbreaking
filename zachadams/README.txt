###What is a Mern stack in your own word

Mern stack  is a Javascript Stack thatis used to develop full stack applications in a fast was. It contains MongoDB, Express, rest and node.js 

### What's your biggest strength in the Mern Stack(Please be specific).

My strength would be on the back end and creating APIs. I have never used Express or mongoDB but have used Mysql so I know how to deal with databases in the backend.

### What do you want to improve the most in the following 3 months? (Please be specific)

I would like to strengthen my backend skills while learning how to integrate the back end with the front end. I am also excited to learn about new tech I have never used before.

### If we were to work on a project together, do you want to do frontend or the backend? or both?

I would like to do both

1. A stock prediction front end application (I already have a machine learnign model I would just like to use it on the front end)

3. Visualization of how different periods of time effect the world
4. Build a multiplayer game
5. Create a personal webpage/blog for myself showcasing everything Ive done

I can only think of 5 ideas at the moment

### How much do you plan to allocate to this group for coding?(please be specific)
