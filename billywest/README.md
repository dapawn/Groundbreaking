### What is a Mern stack in your own word

MERN Stack is a development web stack built using JavaScript. (M)ongoDB is used by the backend application for its document database to store and combine data of any structure, and it does not carry the same limitations of a relational database. (E)xpress is just the back-end web framework that runs on top of Node.js to handle the back-end application. Express is used to set up your server, APIs, routing of request, etc. (R)eact is JavaScript frontend library that represents the view element of an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern. It is responsible for the Client facing or User Interfacing side of the application. (N)odeJS is the JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to implement the application's backend in JavaScript (via Express).

### What's your biggest strength in the Mern Stack(Please be specific).

My strength definitely would be on the frontend side, so that would make it React. However, I am comfortable with the entire stack so I can easily switch between the frontend and the backend development based on the requirement of the project itself.

### What do you want to improve the most in the following 3 months? (Please be specific)

I would want to strengthen my skills on the backend while learning new technologies like GraphQL. Also, given the opportunity, I would love to get my hands dirty in the whole data-modeling and system design process for enterprise applications. I want to be involved in all phases of the development lifecycle so that I may have an understanding of the entire process.

### If we were to work on a project together, do you want to do frontend or the backend? or both?

Preferably both but would settle for the backend.

### List 10 ideas that you want to make it into an app and share with the group.

1. Support ticketing system or issue tracker.
2. An Ecommerce application.
3. Application that provides realtime information on the Corona Virus utilizing third-party APIs (e.g. CDC APIs).
4. A Chat Application.
5. An application with User Authentication.
6. Portfolio Website.
7. A Social Network Application.
8. A multi-language Blog application.
9. A Weather Application.
10. Build a JavaScript Game.

### How much do you plan to allocate to this group for coding?(please be specific)

I am willing to give as much time as possible. Currently, I have a lot more time due to the stay at home orders, but that may change afterward.

### Is Saturday afternoon 4pm always the best for meeting?

Saturday 4:00 pm works for me but I'm open to whatever the group decides.
