### What is a Mern stack in your own word

A full-stack comprised of MongoDB, Express, React and Node.

### What's your biggest strength in the Mern Stack(Please be specific).

React and design (CSS/SASS)

### What do you want to improve the most in the following 3 months? (Please be specific)

React, but also want to keep up skills in Node/Express and get better with DBs.

### If we were to work on a project together, do you want to do frontend or the backend? or both?

Both, but probably more front-end.

### List 10 ideas that you want to make it into an app and share with the group.

- an app that helps connect volunteer mentors with people who are looking for mentors
- an app that helps people find doctors near them that accept their insurance (like Zocdoc except includes medicaid + no-insurance, which last time I checked Zocdoc doesn't help with)
- a playlist sharing app/music taste social media app (something like lastFM x what Myspace was at its peak)
- an app for finding public bathrooms
- a recipe sharing app (people can create/post recipes and other people can fork them like on github/codepen and edit their own versions)
- an app that helps people organize their workplace securely (something like Signal). ie. employees want to unionize but want to communicate without scrutiny from company bosses.
- an app for keeping track of code tutorials and snippets that's geared towards coders (something better than just bookmarks + note-taking app
- a social media app that just keeps track of people with names and faces, birthdays and important information (minimal facebook/digital rolodex)
- multi-media mood journal (user can upload photos, images, videos, drawings, etc)
- app that helps people stay updated about protest actions, when and where they are happening, in real time.

### How much do you plan to allocate to this group for coding?(please be specific)
until bootcamp ends, I will probably only be able to do up to 5 hours week. in a month from now though, I can do more like 10-15 hours a week.

### Is Saturday afternoon 4pm always the best for meeting?
works fine for me.

### Please share some links to your portfolio, personal website, works that you aree proud of.

here is a link to my portfolio as it stands right now (updating with some new projects in May) - https://paulbaisley.com

also, this is my record label (what I was up to from 2009-2019 before I seriously code into programming) - http://www.astronauti.co (need to make a new website for it this year.)
