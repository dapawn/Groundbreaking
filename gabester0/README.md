### What is a Mern stack in your own word
>MERN stack is a development stack that uses MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.

### What's your biggest strength in the Mern Stack(Please be specific). 
>My biggest strenth in the MERN Stack is React and JavaScript in general.  

### What do you want to improve the most in the following 3 months? (Please be specific)
>I want to become very comfortable with the backend, database and putting together full-stack websites.  I want to be very confident working in a professional Agile team environment.  I want to start learning how to test software I am writing.

### If we were to work on a project together, do you want to do frontend or the backend? or both?
> I would want to work on the backend or both

### List 10 ideas that you want to make it into an app and share with the group. 
 - A customizable to-do list application that is open source.  Data would be stored privately (locally, or on your own Github repo?)
 - A portfolio site generator application.  2 parts: 1st part is users select a portfolio template and input their info to generate a portfolio site.  2nd part is educational and interactive; you learn about creating the site and create a custom template yourself that is added to the template library.  
 - A Technical documentation project that teaches how to create MERN stack projects.  Users would learn and practice by potentially contributing to the documentation themselves
 - An app to find services and/or products from small local businesses.  Users can report products and services and other users can verify.  Crowd-source the information used
 - A playlist sharing app/music taste social media app (something like lastFM x what Myspace was at its peak) -- Paul's idea
 - an app for finding public bathrooms -- Paul's idea
 - A recipe sharing app (people can create/post recipes and other people can fork them like on github/codepen and edit their own versions) -- Paul's idea
 - An app that helps people organize their workplace securely (something like Signal). ie. employees want to unionize but want to communicate without scrutiny from company bosses. -- Paul's idea
 - A social media app that just keeps track of people with names and faces, birthdays and important information (minimal facebook/digital rolodex) -- Paul's idea
 - an app for keeping track of code tutorials and snippets that's geared towards coders (something better than just bookmarks + note-taking app -- Paul's idea

### How much do you plan to allocate to this group for coding?(please be specific)
> 5 to 10 hours per week

### Is Saturday afternoon 4pm always the best for meeting?
> It is a good time for me.  I am flexible right now

### Please share some links to your portfolio, personal website, works that you are proud of.
