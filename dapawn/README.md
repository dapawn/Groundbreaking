### What is a Mern stack in your own word
A Web development platform that uses MongoDB for the database backend, Express to handle routing and APIs, React as a frontend Javascript platform where you can make reuseable components, and Node as the backend server

### What's your biggest strength in the Mern Stack(Please be specific). 
I've used React the most, played a little with Node and Express. I haven't used MongoDB.

### What do you want to improve the most in the following 3 months? (Please be specific)
I want to become a competent MERN satack developer. Right now I don't feel like I really know what I'm doing, don't think I could code the Blackjack game in 2 hours. :-)

### If we were to work on a project together, do you want to do frontend or the backend? or both?
I'd like to both, I need the experience. :-)

### List 10 ideas that you want to make it into an app and share with the group. 
Online multiplayer 'Monopoly Deal' card game clone
Sheriff Sale/Auction property search app

A 'Lemmings' clone.
An app that will search Craigslist, Offerup, Letgo, etc. to find the stuff you want
Part2 would be one that would also post to the classified sites
Battleship?
Online multiplayer Uno
voice/chat app goes nice with games
Videochat app (don't know how feesible, but may go nice with games)

### How much do you plan to allocate to this group for coding?(please be specific)
I should be able to devote 10-20 hours/week for coding.

### Is Saturday afternoon 4pm always the best for meeting?
Is should work for me, most of the time.
